00:00.000 --> 00:19.000,"What is the characteristic difference between Orthodox Christianity and Catholic Christianity on the one hand, and Orthodox Christianity and Protestant Christianity on the other? Is there an essential difference between Orthodoxy's relationships to both?"
00:19.000 --> 00:35.000,"First, so far as Catholic Christianity goes, the root difference, the most important single difference, in my view, is the papal claims."
00:36.000 --> 00:48.000,"We are willing, on the Orthodox side, to accept that in a reunited Christendom, the Pope would have the first place."
00:49.000 --> 01:00.000,But we don't believe that he should have universal power of jurisdiction.
01:01.000 --> 01:17.000,"He simply has a role of coordination, of leadership, but so far as the Christian East goes, not a power of direct, immediate and ordinary jurisdiction."
01:18.000 --> 01:19.000,"So,"
01:20.000 --> 01:25.000,there I see the biggest difference between Orthodoxy and Rome.
01:26.000 --> 01:44.000,"Of course, there is also the question of the procession of the Holy Spirit, the Filioque, and, to some extent, the question of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which we Orthodox don't agree with."
01:45.000 --> 01:47.000,"But,"
01:48.000 --> 01:57.000,"at the present moment, in the international dialogue between our two churches, we are concentrating on the papacy."
01:58.000 --> 02:04.000,"And I think if we could solve that, the other issues wouldn't be so difficult."
02:05.000 --> 02:15.000,"As regards Protestantism, it is much more complex because there is such variety of belief among the Protestants."
02:16.000 --> 02:26.000,"In the past, the group with which the Orthodox felt closest was the Anglican Church, the Episcopalians."
02:27.000 --> 02:32.000,I would say the high point of our dialogue with the Anglicans was in the 1930s.
02:33.000 --> 02:41.000,But there have been a lot of changes in Anglicanism which are difficult for the Orthodox.
02:41.000 --> 03:05.000,"Not only the ordination of women priests and bishops, but also the question of appointing practising homosexuals to high positions in the church, and the practice that is now beginning in some Anglican churches of blessing same-sex marriages."
03:06.000 --> 03:10.000,And that is very problematic for the Orthodox.
03:11.000 --> 03:17.000,"With the Roman Catholics, we have a great deal in common."
03:18.000 --> 03:33.000,"Our view of the communion of saints, our view of the sacraments is not so different, though of course there are some points of divergence."
03:34.000 --> 03:36.000,"Whereas with the Protestant world,"
03:36.000 --> 03:42.000,we have far more differences.
03:43.000 --> 03:46.000,Why is the finding of ancient Christianity an important quest?
03:47.000 --> 03:55.000,What might you tell a modern Western evangelical who suspected that such inquiry about ancient Christianity was inspired only by pomp and a fancy for ritual?
03:56.000 --> 04:01.000,The first and most important thing about ancient Christianity
04:02.000 --> 04:06.000,is the faith of the early church.
04:07.000 --> 04:12.000,"Not ritual, not pomp."
04:13.000 --> 04:21.000,"We Orthodox believe that for our understanding of the faith today,"
04:22.000 --> 04:34.000,"we should look back to the period of the ecumenical councils of the ancient fathers,"
04:35.000 --> 04:42.000,to the period where the Greek East and the Latin West were united in communion.
04:43.000 --> 04:55.000,And what we are looking for is primarily what was the understanding of the faith in the ancient church.
04:56.000 --> 05:01.000,How did they understand the New Testament?
05:02.000 --> 05:09.000,So we would look at the continuity from the apostolic period onwards.
05:10.000 --> 05:13.000,That would be our guide.
05:14.000 --> 05:20.000,But of course tradition needs to be living tradition.
05:21.000 --> 05:28.000,We cannot simply go back to the period of the early fathers and the councils
05:29.000 --> 05:31.000,in an archaeological way.
05:32.000 --> 05:38.000,We cannot simply repeat in a parrot-like manner what they said.
05:39.000 --> 05:42.000,We have to relive their experience.
05:43.000 --> 05:51.000,"We have to ask ourselves how are we to interpret the message of the early church,"
05:52.000 --> 05:54.000,the unchanging message.
05:54.000 --> 05:59.000,How are we to present this in terms of today's world?
06:00.000 --> 06:06.000,So our honouring of tradition is living tradition.
06:07.000 --> 06:14.000,But we start with the faith rather than with a particular type of ritual.
06:15.000 --> 06:17.000,"Precious though the Byzantine liturgy is,"
06:18.000 --> 06:22.000,what is fundamentally important is the faith that is enshrined in the liturgy.
06:22.000 --> 06:27.000,Then the ancient traditions that are not extant within modern Western Protestantism.
06:28.000 --> 06:31.000,Why are these facets of ancient Christianity so crucial for the faith?
06:32.000 --> 06:40.000,We should take as our starting point the Holy Eucharist.
06:41.000 --> 06:46.000,Communion in the Body and Blood of Christ.
06:46.000 --> 06:54.000,We are to see the church essentially as a Eucharistic community.
06:55.000 --> 07:02.000,The church becomes truly itself when celebrating the divine liturgy.
07:03.000 --> 07:11.000,So what is lacking for us in much of Protestantism
07:12.000 --> 07:15.000,is the acceptance that the Holy Communion
07:16.000 --> 07:19.000,is truly the Body and Blood of Christ.
07:20.000 --> 07:24.000,"That is believed I suppose by the Lutherans,"
07:25.000 --> 07:31.000,but we also as Orthodox believe that the divine liturgy is a mystical sacrifice.
07:32.000 --> 07:35.000,That of course the Lutherans would not accept.
07:36.000 --> 07:44.000,But for so many Protestants the Eucharist is seen simply as a memorial meal.
07:44.000 --> 07:48.000,And that would not be sufficient for us as Orthodox.
07:49.000 --> 07:54.000,I was brought up from childhood in the Anglican Church.
07:56.000 --> 08:00.000,And I have good memories of Anglicanism.
08:01.000 --> 08:08.000,"If I left the Anglican Church and became Orthodox it was not for negative reasons,"
08:09.000 --> 08:12.000,"because I objected to things in Anglicanism,"
08:12.000 --> 08:13.000,"but rather to the fact that,"
08:14.000 --> 08:15.000,"rather for positive reasons,"
08:16.000 --> 08:23.000,because I found in Orthodoxy a fullness that I did not find in Anglicanism.
08:24.000 --> 08:29.000,Now the Anglican Church that I knew sixty years ago
08:30.000 --> 08:33.000,was very different from what it is now.
08:34.000 --> 08:37.000,"I was brought up in a traditional Anglicanism,"
08:38.000 --> 08:40.000,"mainly in the High Church tradition,"
08:41.000 --> 08:43.000,and so I was brought up in an Anglicanism
08:44.000 --> 08:49.000,that honoured the fathers and the ancient councils.
08:50.000 --> 08:56.000,And certainly I was taught that the Eucharist is the true Body and Blood of Christ
08:57.000 --> 09:02.000,and that one should go to confession.
09:03.000 --> 09:09.000,"But what troubled me then, and would trouble me today,"
09:10.000 --> 09:13.000,is the diversity of viewpoints within Anglicanism.
09:15.000 --> 09:19.000,"There is of course the High Church tradition in which I was brought up,"
09:20.000 --> 09:23.000,but there is also the evangelical wing of the Anglican Church
09:24.000 --> 09:28.000,"and, still more troubling, the liberal wing,"
09:29.000 --> 09:35.000,"liberal Anglicans who deny the bodily resurrection of Christ, even his Godhead."
09:36.000 --> 09:41.000,And I was troubled by this diversity within Anglicanism.
09:42.000 --> 09:47.000,"I found in becoming Orthodox I did not have to change my faith,"
09:48.000 --> 09:51.000,"but I could say this is the faith of the Church,"
09:52.000 --> 09:54.000,"instead of having to say as an Anglican,"
09:55.000 --> 10:00.000,this is the faith of the particular group within Anglicanism to which I belong.
10:01.000 --> 10:08.000,"So I would prefer to say that in becoming Orthodox I was not rejecting Anglicanism,"
10:08.000 --> 10:14.000,"but I was finding a firm basis for the faith I had already held as an Anglican,"
10:15.000 --> 10:21.000,"but a firm basis in the sense that I could say this is the teaching of the Church,"
10:22.000 --> 10:27.000,not just this is the teaching of a certain group with which I am linked.
10:28.000 --> 10:33.000,And in that sense I found a fullness within Orthodoxy.
10:34.000 --> 10:37.000,"I do not wish to say that other Christian bodies have nothing,"
10:37.000 --> 10:44.000,we are not to think in terms of a contrast between light and then unredeemed darkness.
10:45.000 --> 10:49.000,"There are many elements of Orthodoxy to be found in Anglicanism,"
10:50.000 --> 10:52.000,"particularly the High Church Anglican tradition,"
10:53.000 --> 10:59.000,"as represented by people like the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey."
11:00.000 --> 11:06.000,"But one could not say as an Anglican, this is the faith of our Church."
11:07.000 --> 11:14.000,"As an Orthodox I am able to say this is not simply the faith of a group that I choose to belong to,"
11:15.000 --> 11:17.000,this is the faith of the total Church.
11:18.000 --> 11:24.000,It gave me a firm basis for what I had already been taught to believe as an Anglican.
11:25.000 --> 11:30.000,You uniquely bring us through the world in a way that private personal faith alone cannot.
11:31.000 --> 11:34.000,"To answer that we might first ask,"
11:34.000 --> 11:38.000,how did the Church start?
11:41.000 --> 11:49.000,And what we are told in the opening chapters of the Book of Acts was
11:50.000 --> 12:00.000,"that those who turned to Christ, who were converted, were first of all baptised."
12:00.000 --> 12:09.000,"And then we are told that what the early Christians did was to break bread together,"
12:10.000 --> 12:13.000,to celebrate the Eucharist.
12:14.000 --> 12:18.000,"And the sharing together in Holy Communion,"
12:19.000 --> 12:25.000,"from the very beginning, has been central to the life of the Church."
12:26.000 --> 12:29.000,"So Christ did not simply say,"
12:30.000 --> 12:36.000,"at the Last Supper, believe these things."
12:37.000 --> 12:42.000,"He said, do this in remembrance of me."
12:43.000 --> 12:46.000,"Christ bequeathed to his disciples,"
12:48.000 --> 12:52.000,"not just a theory, an ideology,"
12:53.000 --> 12:55.000,but an action.
12:56.000 --> 12:59.000,And an action that could only be performed
13:00.000 --> 13:04.000,"by people together,"
13:05.000 --> 13:07.000,not alone.
13:08.000 --> 13:10.000,The action of the Eucharist.
13:11.000 --> 13:16.000,"So yes indeed, personal faith is presupposed."
13:17.000 --> 13:21.000,We do each need to believe personally.
13:22.000 --> 13:24.000,But that is not enough.
13:25.000 --> 13:29.000,"Since Christianity is founded on the Eucharist,"
13:30.000 --> 13:35.000,"the command of Christ at the Last Supper,"
13:35.000 --> 13:37.000,do this.
13:37.000 --> 13:42.000,We need to belong to a worshipping community.
13:42.000 --> 13:45.000,A worshipping community that celebrates
13:45.000 --> 13:50.000,the Holy Mystery of his Body and Blood.
13:51.000 --> 13:57.000,This is why simply to have personal faith is not enough.
13:57.000 --> 13:59.000,"That personal faith is expressed,"
13:59.000 --> 14:06.000,through the corporate action of the Church community.
14:06.000 --> 14:10.000,The corporate action of Holy Communion.
14:10.000 --> 14:12.000,"The Orthodox Church,"
14:12.000 --> 14:15.000,"the understanding of its members,"
14:15.000 --> 14:20.000,is the true Church of Christ on Earth.
14:20.000 --> 14:26.000,It is the one Catholic Apostolic Church of Christ.
14:26.000 --> 14:29.000,"Therefore,"
14:31.000 --> 14:37.000,we would be happy if everybody became Orthodox.
14:39.000 --> 14:41.000,"In that sense,"
14:41.000 --> 14:45.000,the Orthodox Church has a universal mission.
14:47.000 --> 14:52.000,But we in the Orthodox Church do not think it right
14:53.000 --> 14:55.000,to practice
14:55.000 --> 14:58.000,negative proselytism.
15:00.000 --> 15:02.000,"In other words,"
15:02.000 --> 15:10.000,we do not wish to seek out members of other churches
15:10.000 --> 15:14.000,and to attack their beliefs
15:14.000 --> 15:17.000,and seek to undermine
15:17.000 --> 15:20.000,their loyalty to the Church they belong to.
15:21.000 --> 15:23.000,"We do not think it right,"
15:23.000 --> 15:24.000,"in this way,"
15:24.000 --> 15:29.000,to attack other churches
15:29.000 --> 15:34.000,and to disturb Christians in their faith.
15:34.000 --> 15:39.000,"If people ask us about the Orthodox Church,"
15:39.000 --> 15:43.000,indeed we are happy to tell them.
15:45.000 --> 15:48.000,And if they feel
15:48.000 --> 15:52.000,"that they should join the Orthodox Church,"
15:52.000 --> 15:53.000,"then,"
15:53.000 --> 15:54.000,"yes,"
15:54.000 --> 15:56.000,the door is open.
15:57.000 --> 16:00.000,But I do not think it our task
16:00.000 --> 16:04.000,to undertake evangelism
16:04.000 --> 16:06.000,and missionary work
16:06.000 --> 16:09.000,against other Christians.
16:11.000 --> 16:15.000,"If we are going to undertake evangelistic work,"
16:15.000 --> 16:17.000,then let us
16:17.000 --> 16:21.000,go to the people who belong to no church
16:21.000 --> 16:24.000,and have no Christian faith.
16:24.000 --> 16:26.000,And there are plenty of those
16:26.000 --> 16:29.000,in Britain and in Western Europe.
16:29.000 --> 16:33.000,So I do not think of us
16:33.000 --> 16:35.000,as carrying out
16:35.000 --> 16:37.000,a missionary campaign
16:37.000 --> 16:40.000,at the expense of other Christians.
16:40.000 --> 16:42.000,"But, of course,"
16:42.000 --> 16:44.000,"if they ask us,"
16:44.000 --> 16:47.000,we would have insincerity to tell them
16:47.000 --> 16:50.000,the points where we didn't agree with them.
16:51.000 --> 16:53.000,"I think of this statement,"
16:53.000 --> 16:54.000,"quote,"
16:54.000 --> 16:56.000,as the first thousand years of Christendom
16:56.000 --> 16:57.000,were those of unity
16:57.000 --> 16:59.000,"and the second thousand of disunity,"
16:59.000 --> 17:01.000,so the third thousand years of Christendom
17:01.000 --> 17:03.000,will be of reunity.
17:03.000 --> 17:05.000,"First of all,"
17:05.000 --> 17:07.000,unity was not complete
17:07.000 --> 17:11.000,in the first thousand years.
17:11.000 --> 17:13.000,"Already,"
17:13.000 --> 17:15.000,there was a division
17:15.000 --> 17:17.000,in the fifth and sixth century
17:17.000 --> 17:20.000,between those who accepted
17:20.000 --> 17:22.000,"the Council of Chalcedon,"
17:22.000 --> 17:24.000,"451,"
17:24.000 --> 17:26.000,and those who rejected it.
17:26.000 --> 17:28.000,"And so,"
17:28.000 --> 17:30.000,we have already a division
17:30.000 --> 17:33.000,"between the non-Chalcedonian churches,"
17:33.000 --> 17:36.000,"that's to say the Copts,"
17:36.000 --> 17:38.000,"the Ethiopians,"
17:38.000 --> 17:39.000,"the Syrians,"
17:39.000 --> 17:40.000,"the Armenians,"
17:40.000 --> 17:43.000,"and on the other side,"
17:43.000 --> 17:46.000,"the Chalcedonian churches,"
17:46.000 --> 17:49.000,"the Orthodox Church,"
17:49.000 --> 17:53.000,and the Roman Catholic Church.
17:53.000 --> 17:54.000,"So,"
17:54.000 --> 17:56.000,there was already a division
17:56.000 --> 17:59.000,in the first millennium.
17:59.000 --> 18:01.000,"Now,"
18:01.000 --> 18:04.000,in the second half
18:04.000 --> 18:05.000,of the 20th century
18:05.000 --> 18:08.000,"from the 1960s onwards,"
18:08.000 --> 18:11.000,there was considerable progress
18:11.000 --> 18:13.000,in reconciliation
18:13.000 --> 18:16.000,"between the Orthodox Church,"
18:16.000 --> 18:18.000,"that's to say the Greek, Russian,"
18:18.000 --> 18:19.000,"and Romanian,"
18:19.000 --> 18:21.000,and other Orthodox churches
18:21.000 --> 18:23.000,"on the one side,"
18:23.000 --> 18:25.000,"and the non-Chalcedonians,"
18:25.000 --> 18:26.000,"the Copts,"
18:26.000 --> 18:27.000,"the Ethiopians,"
18:27.000 --> 18:28.000,"the Armenians,"
18:28.000 --> 18:30.000,on the other.
18:30.000 --> 18:33.000,And they have not yet
18:33.000 --> 18:36.000,"restored communion,"
18:36.000 --> 18:39.000,but it has been said
18:39.000 --> 18:40.000,on each side
18:40.000 --> 18:43.000,that the main doctrinal difficulties
18:43.000 --> 18:45.000,concerning the person of Christ
18:45.000 --> 18:47.000,have been clarified
18:47.000 --> 18:50.000,and agreement has been reached.
18:50.000 --> 18:51.000,So I hope
18:51.000 --> 18:53.000,in the next 20 or 30 years
18:53.000 --> 18:56.000,there would be reconciliation there.
18:56.000 --> 18:58.000,So there was division
18:58.000 --> 19:00.000,in the first millennium
19:00.000 --> 19:03.000,behind the division
19:03.000 --> 19:05.000,between Rome and Protestantism
19:05.000 --> 19:07.000,"in the 16th century,"
19:07.000 --> 19:09.000,and behind the division
19:09.000 --> 19:12.000,"between Eastern and Western Christendom,"
19:12.000 --> 19:15.000,which evolved over a long period
19:15.000 --> 19:17.000,but is usually fixed
19:17.000 --> 19:20.000,the division to the 11th century.
19:20.000 --> 19:22.000,There is this earlier division
19:22.000 --> 19:24.000,that we should not forget.
19:24.000 --> 19:28.000,So in the end of the second millennium
19:28.000 --> 19:30.000,there's already been a movement
19:30.000 --> 19:35.000,towards reconciliation.
19:35.000 --> 19:38.000,I consider that it's going to be
19:38.000 --> 19:40.000,much more difficult
19:40.000 --> 19:43.000,for an agreement to be reached
19:43.000 --> 19:46.000,between Orthodoxy and Rome.
19:46.000 --> 19:50.000,But with the help of the Holy Spirit
19:50.000 --> 19:53.000,all things are possible
19:53.000 --> 19:55.000,and we should remain
19:55.000 --> 19:57.000,in dialogue together.
19:57.000 --> 20:01.000,What will happen in the third millennium
20:01.000 --> 20:03.000,is known to God
20:03.000 --> 20:04.000,and not to me.
20:04.000 --> 20:07.000,We should not isolate
20:07.000 --> 20:11.000,"the incident of 1054,"
20:11.000 --> 20:15.000,the estrangement a bit
20:15.000 --> 20:18.000,between the Orthodox Church
20:18.000 --> 20:22.000,and Rome
20:22.000 --> 20:27.000,was a gradually evolving process.
20:27.000 --> 20:30.000,And the roots of it go back
20:30.000 --> 20:33.000,a long time before the 11th century.
20:33.000 --> 20:38.000,And on the other hand
20:38.000 --> 20:40.000,the division was not completed
20:40.000 --> 20:44.000,until some time after the 11th century.
20:44.000 --> 20:47.000,So 1054 is just one incident
20:47.000 --> 20:52.000,in a much longer story.
20:52.000 --> 20:55.000,What happened was that there were already
20:55.000 --> 21:01.000,tensions between East and West.
21:01.000 --> 21:05.000,Cardinal Humbert came as delegate
21:05.000 --> 21:09.000,from the Pope to Constantinople
21:09.000 --> 21:11.000,on what was intended to be
21:11.000 --> 21:14.000,a mission of reconciliation.
21:14.000 --> 21:22.000,"But he and the patriarch of Constantinople,"
21:22.000 --> 21:24.000,"Michael Serularius,"
21:24.000 --> 21:28.000,quickly fell out with one another.
21:28.000 --> 21:34.000,One of the key issues at that time
21:34.000 --> 21:39.000,was the use of bread in the Eucharist.
21:39.000 --> 21:44.000,"In the West, unleavened bread"
21:44.000 --> 21:45.000,is used.
21:45.000 --> 21:50.000,"In the East, leavened bread."
21:50.000 --> 21:56.000,And that led to quite a sharp conflict.
21:56.000 --> 21:59.000,"In fact, today,"
21:59.000 --> 22:03.000,many people on both sides would say
22:03.000 --> 22:06.000,"this is not, in the end,"
22:06.000 --> 22:09.000,a fundamental doctrinal question.
22:09.000 --> 22:12.000,There is room in the Church
22:12.000 --> 22:16.000,for different liturgical practices.
22:16.000 --> 22:19.000,The West may follow its practice
22:19.000 --> 22:22.000,and the East its practice
22:22.000 --> 22:25.000,over the nature of the bread in the Eucharist.
22:25.000 --> 22:27.000,That is a view that many Orthodox
22:27.000 --> 22:29.000,would take today.
22:29.000 --> 22:31.000,"However, in the 11th century"
22:31.000 --> 22:35.000,the two sides were not so willing
22:35.000 --> 22:38.000,to allow for diversity.
22:38.000 --> 22:41.000,But already at an earlier point
22:41.000 --> 22:43.000,"in the 9th century,"
22:43.000 --> 22:46.000,there had been a disagreement
22:46.000 --> 22:50.000,between Patriarch Photius at Constantinople
22:50.000 --> 22:52.000,and Pope Nicholas in the West
22:52.000 --> 22:54.000,in the 860s.
22:54.000 --> 22:57.000,"And there the issues were,"
22:57.000 --> 23:01.000,"yes, the procession of the Holy Spirit"
23:01.000 --> 23:05.000,and also the primacy of the Pope.
23:05.000 --> 23:07.000,And these two questions
23:07.000 --> 23:10.000,were not really solved in the 9th century.
23:10.000 --> 23:14.000,And so they also underlay
23:14.000 --> 23:17.000,the difficulties in the 11th.
23:17.000 --> 23:24.000,"Anyway, Humbert and Serularius disagreed."
23:24.000 --> 23:29.000,Cardinal Humbert lost patience.
23:29.000 --> 23:34.000,He therefore drew up an anathema
23:34.000 --> 23:38.000,excommunicating Michael Serularius
23:38.000 --> 23:39.000,"and he put it,"
23:39.000 --> 23:42.000,he put it on the altar
23:42.000 --> 23:46.000,of the church in Saint Sophia.
23:46.000 --> 23:48.000,"And in retaliation,"
23:48.000 --> 23:51.000,Michael Serularius and his synod
23:51.000 --> 23:56.000,excommunicated Cardinal Humbert.
23:56.000 --> 24:02.000,But the excommunication of Humbert
24:02.000 --> 24:06.000,was not directed to the Byzantine church
24:06.000 --> 24:07.000,"as a whole,"
24:07.000 --> 24:10.000,only against Serularius.
24:10.000 --> 24:13.000,And the response of Serularius
24:13.000 --> 24:16.000,"was not directed against the Pope,"
24:16.000 --> 24:19.000,but only against Humbert.
24:19.000 --> 24:23.000,So the excommunications were limited in scope.
24:23.000 --> 24:27.000,"However, when Humbert went home,"
24:27.000 --> 24:30.000,he presented the whole incident
24:30.000 --> 24:33.000,as a great victory for the Roman see
24:33.000 --> 24:36.000,and the papacy endorsed it.
24:36.000 --> 24:39.000,He endorsed his anathema.
24:39.000 --> 24:41.000,"And on the other side,"
24:41.000 --> 24:45.000,the emperor supported Michael Serularius.
24:45.000 --> 24:47.000,"So in that way,"
24:47.000 --> 24:51.000,the scope of the anathemas was enlarged.
24:51.000 --> 24:54.000,But this was not the end
24:54.000 --> 24:58.000,of friendly relations between the two churches.
24:58.000 --> 25:02.000,"And in fact, in Byzantium,"
25:02.000 --> 25:05.000,the incident of 1054 was quickly forgotten.
25:06.000 --> 25:09.000,What was much more damaging
25:09.000 --> 25:14.000,was the sack of Constantinople in 1204
25:14.000 --> 25:17.000,by the Fourth Crusade.
25:17.000 --> 25:21.000,That is something which the Christian East
25:21.000 --> 25:25.000,has never forgotten or forgiven.
25:25.000 --> 25:30.000,"So I think the schism dates,"
25:30.000 --> 25:32.000,"if you want to choose a single date,"
25:32.000 --> 25:34.000,much more from 1204.
25:34.000 --> 25:39.000,than from 1054.
25:39.000 --> 25:42.000,But the roots of the division go back
25:42.000 --> 25:45.000,at least to the 9th century
25:45.000 --> 25:50.000,"to the conflict between Photius and Rome,"
25:50.000 --> 25:53.000,even though communion was not
25:53.000 --> 25:56.000,permanently broken at that point.
26:04.000 --> 26:13.000,"First of all,"
26:13.000 --> 26:19.000,the will of our Lord is quite clear.
26:19.000 --> 26:22.000,In the prayer that he offered
26:22.000 --> 26:26.000,"at the Last Supper in John 17,"
26:26.000 --> 26:29.000,"he says with very great emphasis,"
26:29.000 --> 26:32.000,"referring to his disciples,"
26:32.000 --> 26:36.000,may they all be one.
26:36.000 --> 26:39.000,"As you, Father, are one with me"
26:39.000 --> 26:41.000,"and I with you,"
26:41.000 --> 26:46.000,may they also be one in us.
26:46.000 --> 26:49.000,"So, first of all,"
26:49.000 --> 26:52.000,the unity of Christians
26:52.000 --> 26:57.000,is to reflect the unity in diversity
26:57.000 --> 26:59.000,of the Holy Trinity.
26:59.000 --> 27:01.000,That is the basis that Christ gives.
27:01.000 --> 27:04.000,"In his prayer for unity,"
27:04.000 --> 27:06.000,we are to be one
27:06.000 --> 27:10.000,as Christ and the Father are one.
27:10.000 --> 27:14.000,Our unity reflects the mystery
27:14.000 --> 27:16.000,of the Holy Trinity.
27:16.000 --> 27:20.000,Church is an icon of the Holy Trinity.
27:20.000 --> 27:24.000,So the basis for the prayer for unity
27:24.000 --> 27:28.000,is in the life of God himself.
27:28.000 --> 27:30.000,But a second reason
27:30.000 --> 27:34.000,is alongside and arising
27:34.000 --> 27:36.000,out of Christ's prayer
27:36.000 --> 27:39.000,at the Last Supper.
27:39.000 --> 27:43.000,"What the early Christians did,"
27:43.000 --> 27:46.000,"as I have already mentioned,"
27:46.000 --> 27:48.000,from the very beginning
27:48.000 --> 27:50.000,was to break bread together
27:50.000 --> 27:53.000,to celebrate the mystery
27:53.000 --> 27:56.000,of Holy Communion.
27:56.000 --> 27:59.000,Christ wanted his disciples
27:59.000 --> 28:02.000,"to be visibly one,"
28:02.000 --> 28:08.000,to share visibly in the Eucharist.
28:08.000 --> 28:09.000,"And therefore,"
28:09.000 --> 28:11.000,the heart of the problem
28:11.000 --> 28:13.000,of Christian unity is this.
28:13.000 --> 28:19.000,We do not receive communion together.
28:19.000 --> 28:22.000,That is the real problem.
28:22.000 --> 28:24.000,"Now, you might say,"
28:24.000 --> 28:25.000,"in that case,"
28:25.000 --> 28:27.000,why do we not just have communion together
28:27.000 --> 28:29.000,and that will solve everything?
28:29.000 --> 28:32.000,But Holy Communion
28:32.000 --> 28:36.000,is not to be separated from the faith.
28:36.000 --> 28:41.000,And until we agree in the faith
28:41.000 --> 28:43.000,"on the Orthodox understanding,"
28:43.000 --> 28:48.000,we should not share in the sacraments.
28:48.000 --> 28:52.000,"However, I speak of agreement in faith,"
28:52.000 --> 28:57.000,not agreement in theological opinions.
28:57.000 --> 28:58.000,There is room
28:58.000 --> 29:03.000,for diversity of viewpoints.
29:03.000 --> 29:05.000,"What we are seeking is unity,"
29:05.000 --> 29:07.000,not uniformity.
29:07.000 --> 29:09.000,And what we have to clarify
29:09.000 --> 29:11.000,when we as separated Christians
29:11.000 --> 29:13.000,talk together is
29:13.000 --> 29:15.000,which things belong
29:15.000 --> 29:17.000,to the heart and essence
29:17.000 --> 29:19.000,of the Christian faith
29:19.000 --> 29:21.000,"on which we must agree,"
29:21.000 --> 29:24.000,and which things can be left
29:24.000 --> 29:27.000,to private opinion.
29:28.000 --> 29:31.000,"Now, the different Christian groups"
29:31.000 --> 29:35.000,do not agree on where to draw the line.
29:35.000 --> 29:39.000,"So, we do need to be one in faith"
29:39.000 --> 29:42.000,in order to be one in the sacraments.
29:42.000 --> 29:45.000,But unity in the vision of Christ
29:45.000 --> 29:48.000,was indeed to be visible
29:48.000 --> 29:52.000,"because it is founded on the Holy Eucharist,"
29:52.000 --> 29:55.000,which is a visible action.
29:55.000 --> 29:57.000,Or how that would work out
29:57.000 --> 29:59.000,"in a practical way,"
29:59.000 --> 30:02.000,if there's any consensus on that
30:02.000 --> 30:03.000,among the Orthodox.
30:03.000 --> 30:04.000,"The phrase,"
30:04.000 --> 30:06.000,"first among equals,"
30:06.000 --> 30:08.000,"is often applied,"
30:08.000 --> 30:09.000,"is it not,"
30:09.000 --> 30:11.000,to the Pope.
30:11.000 --> 30:12.000,And that is probably
30:12.000 --> 30:14.000,"what you are thinking of,"
30:14.000 --> 30:16.000,the way it is applied to the Pope.
30:16.000 --> 30:19.000,There are three levels of authority
30:19.000 --> 30:21.000,in the Church.
30:21.000 --> 30:24.000,And this was recently stated
30:24.000 --> 30:27.000,in the revenge
30:27.000 --> 30:29.000,document put out
30:29.000 --> 30:31.000,by the International Commission
30:31.000 --> 30:34.000,for dialogue between the Orthodox
30:34.000 --> 30:36.000,and the Roman Catholics
30:36.000 --> 30:40.000,in 2007.
30:40.000 --> 30:43.000,And the revenge document distinguishes
30:43.000 --> 30:46.000,first the authority
30:46.000 --> 30:48.000,of the local bishop
30:48.000 --> 30:51.000,in his diocese.
30:51.000 --> 30:55.000,Then you have regional authority
30:55.000 --> 30:57.000,or regional primacy.
30:57.000 --> 31:01.000,And that means for us Orthodox
31:01.000 --> 31:04.000,the position of the patriarchs
31:04.000 --> 31:07.000,and heads of the autocephalous churches.
31:07.000 --> 31:09.000,"And then thirdly,"
31:09.000 --> 31:11.000,the Ravenna document
31:11.000 --> 31:15.000,distinguished the universal primacy
31:15.000 --> 31:18.000,of the Pope.
31:18.000 --> 31:22.000,Now I think the phrase
31:22.000 --> 31:25.000,first among equals
31:25.000 --> 31:28.000,applies to the second level.
31:28.000 --> 31:30.000,The Pope is the senior
31:30.000 --> 31:32.000,among the patriarchs
31:32.000 --> 31:34.000,and therefore
31:34.000 --> 31:37.000,the first among equals.
31:37.000 --> 31:40.000,But Ravenna also said
31:40.000 --> 31:43.000,and the Orthodox agreed with this
31:43.000 --> 31:46.000,that the Pope does have
31:46.000 --> 31:49.000,a special ministry
31:49.000 --> 31:52.000,beyond that of being patriarch
31:52.000 --> 31:54.000,in the West.
31:54.000 --> 31:57.000,That he is also endowed
31:57.000 --> 31:59.000,with a universal authority
31:59.000 --> 32:02.000,over the whole church.
32:02.000 --> 32:05.000,Not a power of direct jurisdiction
32:05.000 --> 32:08.000,on the Orthodox understanding.
32:08.000 --> 32:12.000,But he has a certain ministry
32:12.000 --> 32:16.000,to watch over the unity
32:16.000 --> 32:18.000,of the church.
32:18.000 --> 32:21.000,But the Ravenna document says
32:21.000 --> 32:24.000,there must be mutual consultation
32:24.000 --> 32:26.000,the Pope as first
32:26.000 --> 32:28.000,should not do anything
32:28.000 --> 32:32.000,without consulting the patriarchs
32:32.000 --> 32:34.000,and they should not do anything
32:34.000 --> 32:36.000,without consulting the Pope.
32:36.000 --> 32:39.000,Mutual consultation.
32:39.000 --> 32:42.000,All of this is implied
32:42.000 --> 32:44.000,in the Ravenna document
32:44.000 --> 32:47.000,rather than stated clearly.
32:47.000 --> 32:50.000,But there is there the suggestion
32:50.000 --> 32:52.000,that the Pope
32:52.000 --> 32:56.000,as supreme pontiff
32:56.000 --> 32:58.000,has a ministry
32:58.000 --> 33:00.000,that is different from that
33:00.000 --> 33:02.000,of the other patriarchs.
33:02.000 --> 33:05.000,Now not all Orthodox would accept that.
33:05.000 --> 33:08.000,But the Orthodox at Ravenna agreed to it.
33:08.000 --> 33:10.000,However we are now having
33:10.000 --> 33:12.000,further discussions to work out
33:12.000 --> 33:15.000,exactly what this signifies.
33:15.000 --> 33:18.000,So the title first among equals
33:18.000 --> 33:20.000,applies really to the middle
33:20.000 --> 33:21.000,level of authority.
33:21.000 --> 33:24.000,What I call regional primacy.
33:24.000 --> 33:26.000,The patriarchs.
33:26.000 --> 33:30.000,But there is an understanding
33:30.000 --> 33:32.000,among many Orthodox
33:32.000 --> 33:35.000,that the Pope has a special position
33:35.000 --> 33:36.000,in the church.
33:36.000 --> 33:39.000,And there is plenty of evidence
33:39.000 --> 33:41.000,to support that
33:41.000 --> 33:43.000,from the first millennium
33:43.000 --> 33:46.000,when there was communion between us.
33:46.000 --> 33:48.000,And we are looking at that evidence
33:48.000 --> 33:49.000,at the moment
33:49.000 --> 33:50.000,and trying to see
33:50.000 --> 33:51.000,whether we can reach
33:51.000 --> 33:54.000,a common understanding on this basis.
33:54.000 --> 33:55.000,What would you say to Christians
33:55.000 --> 33:56.000,of all stripes
33:56.000 --> 33:58.000,whether Southern Baptist
33:58.000 --> 33:59.000,or Methodist
33:59.000 --> 34:00.000,or Catholic
34:00.000 --> 34:03.000,or even Eastern Orthodox
34:03.000 --> 34:05.000,that they can do to work for
34:05.000 --> 34:07.000,in their own small ways
34:07.000 --> 34:10.000,greater unity among one another?
34:10.000 --> 34:12.000,The most important thing
34:12.000 --> 34:14.000,that we can do
34:14.000 --> 34:17.000,to bring about greater unity
34:17.000 --> 34:19.000,is for each one of us
34:19.000 --> 34:25.000,in our different church traditions
34:25.000 --> 34:29.000,to come closer to Christ.
34:29.000 --> 34:31.000,Three things go together
34:31.000 --> 34:34.000,in work for unity.
34:34.000 --> 34:38.000,"Truth, unity and holiness."
34:38.000 --> 34:40.000,There can be no unity
34:40.000 --> 34:43.000,except unity in the truth.
34:43.000 --> 34:46.000,But also there can be no unity
34:46.000 --> 34:48.000,except unity
34:48.000 --> 34:50.000,in holiness.
34:50.000 --> 34:54.000,If we would all draw nearer to Christ
34:54.000 --> 34:56.000,we would also
34:56.000 --> 35:00.000,all of us draw nearer to one another.
35:00.000 --> 35:02.000,So the best thing we can do
35:02.000 --> 35:04.000,to help the work of Christianity
35:04.000 --> 35:06.000,the work of Christian unity
35:06.000 --> 35:08.000,each one of us
35:08.000 --> 35:10.000,is to be converted
35:10.000 --> 35:12.000,more deeply
35:12.000 --> 35:14.000,more radically
35:14.000 --> 35:16.000,to Christ
35:16.000 --> 35:18.000,our one Saviour.
35:18.000 --> 35:19.000,Amen.
