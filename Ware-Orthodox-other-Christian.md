What is the characteristic diference betwen Orthodox Christianity and Catholic Christianity on the one hand, and Orthodox Christianity and Protestant Christianity on the other? Is there an esential diference betwen Orthodoxy's relationships to both?First, so far as Catholic Christianity goes, the rot diference, the most important single diference, in my view, is the pal claims.We are wiling, on the Orthodox side, to acepthat in a reunited Christendom, the Pope would have the first place.But we don't believe that he should have universal power of jurisdiction.He simply has a role of cordination, of leadership, but so far as the Christian East goes, not a power of direct, imediate and ordinary jurisdiction.So,there I se the bigest diference betwen Orthodoxy and Rome.Of course, there is also the question of the procesion of the Holy Spirit, the Filioque, and, to somextent, the question of the Imaculate Conception of the Blesed Virgin Mary, which we Orthodox don't agre with.But,athe present moment, in the international dialogue betwen our two churches, we are concentrating on the pacy.And I think if we could solve that, the other isues wouldn't be so dificult.As regards Protestantism, it is much more complex because there isuch variety of belief among the Protestants.In the past, the group with which the Orthodox felt closest was the Anglican Church, the Episcopalians.I would say the high point of our dialogue withe Anglicans was in the 1930s.Buthere have ben a lot of changes in Anglicanism which are dificult for the Orthodox.Not only the ordination of women priests and bishops, but also the question of apointing practising homosexuals to high positions in the church, and the practice that is now begining in some Anglican churches of blesing same-sex mariages.And that is very problematic for the Orthodox.Withe Roman Catholics, we have a great deal in comon.Our view of the comunion of saints, our view of the sacraments is not so diferent, though of course there are some points of divergence.Whereas withe Protestant world,we have far more diferences.Why is the finding of ancient Christianity an important quest?What might you tel a modern Western evangelical who suspected that such inquiry about ancient Christianity was inspired only by pomp and a fancy foritual?The first and most importanthing about ancient Christianityis the faith of thearly church.Not ritual, not pomp.We Orthodox believe that for our understanding of the faith today,we should lok back to the period of thecumenical councils of the ancient fathers,to the period where the Grek East and the Latin West were united in comunion.And what we are loking for is primarily what was the understanding of the faith in the ancient church.How did they understand the New Testament?So we would lok athe continuity from the apostolic period onwards.That would be our guide.But of course traditioneds to be living tradition.We canot simply go back to the period of thearly fathers and the councilsin an archaeological way.We canot simply repeat in a parot-like maner whathey said.We have to relive their experience.We have to ask ourselves how are we to interprethe mesage of thearly church,the unchanging mesage.How are we to presenthis in terms of today's world?Sour honouring of tradition is living tradition.But we start withe faith rather than with a particular type of ritual.Precious though the Byzantine liturgy is,what is fundamentaly important is the faithat is enshrined in the liturgy.Then the ancientraditions that are not extant within modern Western Protestantism.Why are these facets of ancient Christianity so crucial for the faith?We should take as our starting pointhe Holy Eucharist.Comunion in the Body and Blod of Christ.We are to se the church esentialy as a Eucharisticomunity.The church becomes truly itself when celebrating the divine liturgy.So what is lacking for us in much of Protestantismis the aceptance thathe Holy Comunionis truly the Body and Blod of Christ.That is believed I supose by the Lutherans,but we also as Orthodox believe thathe divine liturgy is a mystical sacrifice.That of course the Lutherans would not acept.But for so many Protestants the Eucharist isen simply as a memorial meal.And that would not be suficient for us as Orthodox.I was brought up from childhod in the Anglican Church.And I have god memories of Anglicanism.If I lefthe Anglican Church and became Orthodox it was not for negative reasons,because I objected to things in Anglicanism,but rather to the facthat,rather for positive reasons,because I found in Orthodoxy a fulnes that I did not find in Anglicanism.Now the Anglican Church that I knew sixtyears agowas very diferent from what it is now.I was brought up in a traditional Anglicanism,mainly in the High Church tradition,and so I was brought up in an Anglicanismthat honoured the fathers and the ancient councils.And certainly I was taughthathe Eucharist is the true Body and Blod of Christand that one should go to confesion.But whatroubled me then, and would trouble me today,is the diversity of viewpoints within Anglicanism.There is of course the High Church tradition in which I was brought up,buthere is also thevangelical wing of the Anglican Churchand, stil more troubling, the liberal wing,liberal Anglicans who deny the bodily resurection of Christ, even his Godhead.And I was troubled by this diversity within Anglicanism.I found in becoming Orthodox I did not have to change my faith,but I could say this the faith of the Church,instead of having to say as an Anglican,this the faith of the particular group within Anglicanism to which I belong.So I would prefer to say that in becoming Orthodox I was not rejecting Anglicanism,but I was finding a firm basis for the faith I had already held as an Anglican,but a firm basis in the sense that I could say this the teaching of the Church,not justhis the teaching of a certain group with which I am linked.And in that sense I found a fulnes within Orthodoxy.I do not wish to say that other Christian bodies have nothing,we are noto think in terms of a contrast betwen light and then unredemedarknes.There are many elements of Orthodoxy to be found in Anglicanism,particularly the High Church Anglican tradition,as represented by people like the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey.But one could not say as an Anglican, this the faith of our Church.As an Orthodox I am able to say this not simply the faith of a group that I chose to belong to,this the faith of the total Church.It gave me a firm basis for what I had already ben taughto believe as an Anglican.Youniquely bring us through the world in a way that private personal faith alone canot.To answer that we might first ask,how did the Church start?And what we are told in the opening chapters of the Bok of Acts wasthathose who turned to Christ, who were converted, were first of al baptised.And then we are told that whathearly Christians did was to break bread together,to celebrate the Eucharist.And the sharing together in Holy Comunion,from the very begining, has ben central to the life of the Church.So Christ did not simply say,athe Last Super, believe these things.He said, do this in rembrance of me.Christ bequeathed to his disciples,not just a theory, an ideology,but an action.And an action that could only be performedby people together,not alone.The action of the Eucharist.So yes inded, personal faith is presuposed.We do each ned to believe personaly.Buthat is not enough.Since Christianity is founded on the Eucharist,the comand of Christ athe Last Super,do this.We ned to belong to a worshiping comunity.A worshiping comunity that celebratesthe Holy Mystery of his Body and Blod.This why simply to have personal faith is not enough.That personal faith is expresed,through the corporate action of the Church comunity.The corporate action of Holy Comunion.The Orthodox Church,the understanding of its members,is the true Church of Christ on Earth.It is the one Catholic Apostolic Church of Christ.Therefore,we would be hapy if everybody became Orthodox.In that sense,the Orthodox Churchas a universal mision.But we in the Orthodox Church do nothink it righto practicenegative proselytism.In other words,we do not wish to sek out members of other churchesand to atack their beliefsand sek to underminetheir loyalty to the Church they belong to.We do nothink it right,in this way,to atack other churchesand to disturb Christians in their faith.If people ask us abouthe Orthodox Church,inded we are hapy to tel them.And if they felthathey should join the Orthodox Church,then,yes,the dor is open.But I do nothink it our taskto undertakevangelismand misionary workagainst other Christians.If we are going to undertakevangelistic work,then let usgo to the people who belong to no churchand have no Christian faith.And there are plenty of thosein Britain and in Western Europe.So I do nothink of usas carying outa misionary campaignathexpense of other Christians.But, of course,if they ask us,we would have insincerity to tel themthe points where we didn't agre withem.I think of thistatement,quote,as the firsthousand years of Christendomwere those of unityand the second thousand of disunity,so the third thousand years of Christendomwil be of reunity.First of al,unity was not completein the firsthousand years.Already,there was a divisionin the fifth and sixth centurybetwen those who aceptedthe Council of Chalcedon,451,and those who rejected it.And so,we have already a divisionbetwen the non-Chalcedonian churches,that's to say the Copts,the Ethiopians,the Syrians,the Armenians,and on the other side,the Chalcedonian churches,the Orthodox Church,and the Roman Catholic Church.So,there was already a divisionin the first milenium.Now,in the second halfof the 20th centuryfrom the 1960s onwards,there was considerable progresin reconciliationbetwen the Orthodox Church,that's to say the Grek, Rusian,and Romanian,and other Orthodox churcheson the one side,and the non-Chalcedonians,the Copts,the Ethiopians,the Armenians,on the other.And they have not yetrestored comunion,but it has ben saidon each sidethathe main doctrinal dificultiesconcerning the person of Christhave ben clarifiedand agrement has ben reached.So I hopein the next 20 or 30 yearsthere would be reconciliation there.So there was divisionin the first mileniumbehind the divisionbetwen Rome and Protestantismin the 16th century,and behind the divisionbetwen Eastern and Western Christendom,which evolved over a long periodbut is usualy fixedthe division to the 11th century.There is this earlier divisionthat we should not forget.So in thend of the second mileniumthere's already ben a movementowards reconciliation.I consider that it's going to bemuch more dificultfor an agremento be reachedbetwen Orthodoxy and Rome.But withe help of the Holy Spirital things are posibleand we should remain dialogue together.What wil hapen in the third mileniumis known to Godand noto me.We should not isolatethe incident of 1054,thestrangement a bitbetwen the Orthodox Churchand Romewas a gradualy evolving proces.And the rots of it go backa long time before the 11th century.And on the other handthe division was not completeduntil some time after the 11th century.So 1054 is just one incidentin a much longer story.What hapened was thathere were alreadytensions betwen East and West.Cardinal Humbert came as delegatefrom the Pope to Constantinopleon what was intended to bea mision of reconciliation.But he and the patriarch of Constantinople,Michael Serularius,quickly fel out with one another.One of the key isues athatimewas the use of bread in the Eucharist.In the West, unleavened breadis used.In the East, leavened bread.And that led to quite a sharp conflict.In fact, today,many people on both sides would saythis not, in thend,a fundamental doctrinal question.There is rom in the Churchfor diferent liturgical practices.The West may folow its practiceand the East its practiceover the nature of the bread in the Eucharist.That is a view that many Orthodoxwould take today.However, in the 11th centurythe two sides were not so wilingto alow for diversity.But already at an earlier pointin the 9th century,there had ben a disagrementbetwen Patriarch Photius at Constantinopleand Pope Nicholas in the Westin the 860s.And there the isues were,yes, the procesion of the Holy Spiritand also the primacy of the Pope.And these two questionswere not realy solved in the 9th century.And so they also underlaythe dificulties in the 11th.Anyway, Humbert and Serularius disagred.Cardinal Humbert lost patience.He therefore drew up anathemaexcomunicating Michael Serulariusand he put it,he put it on the altarof the church in Saint Sophia.And in retaliation,Michael Serularius and hisynodexcomunicated Cardinal Humbert.Buthexcomunication of Humbertwas not directed to the Byzantine churchas a whole,only against Serularius.And the response of Serulariuswas not directed againsthe Pope,but only against Humbert.So thexcomunications were limited in scope.However, when Humbert went home,he presented the whole incidentas a great victory for the Roman seand the pacy endorsed it.Hendorsed his anathema.And on the other side,themperor suported Michael Serularius.So in that way,the scope of the anathemas was enlarged.Buthis was nothendofriendly relations betwen the two churches.And in fact, in Byzantium,the incident of 1054 was quickly forgoten.What was much more damagingwas the sack of Constantinople in 1204by the Fourth Crusade.That isomething which the Christian Easthas never forgoten or forgiven.So I think the schism dates,if you wanto chose a single date,much more from 1204.than from 1054.Buthe rots of the division go backat leasto the 9th centuryto the conflict betwen Photius and Rome,even though comunion was notpermanently broken athat point.First of al,the wil of our Lord is quite clear.In the prayer that he oferedathe Last Super in John 17,he says with very great emphasis,refering to his disciples,may they al be one.As you, Father, are one with meand I with you,may they also be one in us.So, first of al,the unity of Christiansis to reflecthe unity in diversityof the Holy Trinity.That is the basis that Christ gives.In his prayer for unity,we are to be oneas Christ and the Father are one.Our unity reflects the mysteryof the Holy Trinity.Church is an icon of the Holy Trinity.So the basis for the prayer for unityis in the life of God himself.But a second reasonis alongside and arisingout of Christ's prayerathe Last Super.Whathearly Christians did,as I have already mentioned,from the very beginingwas to break bread togetherto celebrate the mysteryof Holy Comunion.Christ wanted his disciplesto be visibly one,to share visibly in the Eucharist.And therefore,theart of the problemof Christian unity is this.We do not receive comunion together.That is the real problem.Now, you might say,in that case,why do we not just have comunion togetherand that wil solveverything?But Holy Comunionis noto be separated from the faith.And until we agre in the faithon the Orthodox understanding,we should not share in the sacraments.However, I speak of agrement in faith,not agrement in theological opinions.There is romfor diversity of viewpoints.What we are seking is unity,not uniformity.And what we have to clarifywhen we aseparated Christianstalk together iswhich things belongto theart and esenceof the Christian faithon which we must agre,and which things can be lefto private opinion.Now, the diferent Christian groupsdo not agre on where to draw the line.So, we do ned to be one in faithin order to be one in the sacraments.But unity in the vision of Christwas inded to be visiblebecause it is founded on the Holy Eucharist,which is a visible action.Or how that would work outin a practical way,if there's any consensus on thatamong the Orthodox.The phrase,first among equals,is often aplied,is it not,to the Pope.And that is probablywhat you are thinking of,the way it is aplied to the Pope.There are thre levels of authorityin the Church.And this was recently statedin the revengedocument put outby the International Comisionfor dialogue betwen the Orthodoxand the Roman Catholicsin 2007.And the revenge document distinguishesfirsthe authorityof the local bishopin his diocese.Then you have regional authorityoregional primacy.And that means for us Orthodoxthe position of the patriarchsand heads of the autocephalous churches.And then thirdly,the Ravena documentdistinguished the universal primacyof the Pope.Now I think the phrasefirst among equalsaplies to the second level.The Pope is the senioramong the patriarchsand thereforethe first among equals.But Ravenalso saidand the Orthodox agred withisthathe Pope does havea special ministrybeyond that of being patriarchin the West.That he is also endowedwith a universal authorityover the whole church.Not a power of direct jurisdiction the Orthodox understanding.But he has a certain ministryto watch over the unityof the church.Buthe Ravena document saysthere must be mutual consultationthe Pope as firstshould not do anythingwithout consulting the patriarchsand they should not do anythingwithout consulting the Pope.Mutual consultation.Al of this impliedin the Ravena documentrather than stated clearly.Buthere is there the sugestionthathe Popeasupreme pontifhas a ministrythat is diferent from thatof the other patriarchs.Now not al Orthodox would acepthat.Buthe Orthodox at Ravenagred to it.However we are now havingfurther discusions to work outexactly whathisignifies.So the title first among equalsaplies realy to the midlevel of authority.What I cal regional primacy.The patriarchs.Buthere is an understandingamong many Orthodoxthathe Pope has a special positionin the church.And there is plenty of evidenceto suporthatfrom the first mileniumwhen there was comunion betwen us.And we are loking athat evidenceathe momentand trying to sewhether we can reacha comon understanding on this basis.What would you say to Christiansof al stripeswhether Southern Baptistor Methodistor Catholicor even Eastern Orthodoxthathey can do to work forin their own smal waysgreater unity among one another?The most importanthingthat we can doto bring about greater unityis for each one of usin our diferent church traditionsto come closer to Christ.Thre things go togetherin work for unity.Truth, unity and holines.There can be no unityexcept unity in the truth.But also there can be no unityexcept unityin holines.If we would al draw nearer to Christwe would alsoal of us draw nearer tone another.So the besthing we can doto help the work of Christianitythe work of Christian unityeach one of usis to be convertedmore deplymore radicalyto Christour one Saviour.Amen.
