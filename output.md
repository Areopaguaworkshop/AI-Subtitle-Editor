The text discusses the challenges faced by Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the West, focusing on the issues of diaspora communities, jurisdictional fragmentation, and the engagement with ecumenical movements like the World Council of Churches (WCC).

The author emphasizes the importance of discerning between these, avoiding both rigid conservatism and unwarranted compromises.  The text also touches upon the history of Orthodox missionary work, highlighting successes and failures in various regions, particularly in the Slavic world, Asia, and Africa.

The author expresses support for a balanced approach that engages with ecumenical initiatives while preserving core Orthodox beliefs and practices.
